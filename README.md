# Getting and Cleaning data Course Project

This is the Coursera curse project for the Getting and Cleaning data.
This repository contains the following files:
 - `README.md` : This file, which provides an overview of this reposet.
 -`tidydata.txt` : It is a dataset processed by run_analysis.R.
 -`codebook.md` : Code book which describes the contents of the tidy data.
 -`run_analysis.R`: This is the script that was used to create tidy dataset.
 
 ## Process of making `run_analysis.R`
 
 1. Down load files and unzip it.
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
 1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variables names.
 1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variables for each activity and each subject.
